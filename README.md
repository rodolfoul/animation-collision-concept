# Animation collision concepts

## How to use?
Simple clone the project and double click index.html to run the application in your browser. 

## Animation programming concepts
- Implements collision detection mechanisms for:
  - canvas shocks
  - Shocks between circles
- Real position for objects once a collision is actually detected.
- ES6 used with pure HTML5 canvas api.

## Physics concepts
- Potential energy calculation at every frame.
- Kinect energy calculation at every frame.
- Total energy calculation at every frame.
- Concepts for calculating mass schocks:
  1. Motion conservation: ![alt tag](https://www.latex4technics.com/l4ttemp/d71s51.png?1488305539921)
  2. Energy conservation: ![alt tag](https://www.latex4technics.com/l4ttemp/d71s51.png?1488305910290)
- Gravity vs no gravity shocks
- What happens to energy on no gravity environments, what changes on once you add gravity to it.
Does collision change anything at all?
- Supposing no attraction between molecules, we have an approximation model to how gas molecules 
would behave at microscopic level.
